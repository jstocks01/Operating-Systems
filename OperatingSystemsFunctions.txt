Accessing bluetooth allows me to connect to podcasts and music.  It allows me to connect to bluetooth speakers around my house.  
I connect it to make phone calls.  You connect the bluetooth by going to the bluetooth settings in your device.  
You ensure your bluetooth setting is on in pair mode.  Then you select the device you are attempting to pair to.
